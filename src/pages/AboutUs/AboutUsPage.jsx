      <h2>Welcome to our world of anime figures!</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        My name is Andrii Halkin, and I created this project with a lot of
        passion and curiosity. As a longtime fan of anime and manga, I have
        always admired the figures that bring beloved characters to life and
        capture their essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is developed as part of a university course, with the aim
        of creating a space to study and showcase collectible figures. Here,
        you’ll find a selection of carefully chosen models that might interest
        both collectors and anyone looking to add something unique to their
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to provide users with high-quality detailed information
        about each figure. We want to make the process of discovering
        collectible figures both engaging and informative.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that this project inspires you and brings joy as you explore the
        world of anime figures. Thank you for your interest in our educational
        project, and welcome to our world!
      </p>
